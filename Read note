Dear Epsilon house:

The only reason you should be viewing and using this in large scale, is in the case where council is a mess and it is necessary for there to be an epsilon house to access this information

This repository serves as an archive containing past data, templates, project files to reference for future epsilon members. Hopefully, you may find the resources avaliable here useful to your council term and learn from our mistakes or build onto our ideas.

It is optional (but highly recommended) to contribute to this archive for future council batches to refer to.

May your council be competent enough to not need to reuse old projects.

Good luck
