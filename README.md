# Epsilon-House-Archives
From 42nd SC,
Dear Epsilon house: 

Welcome to the Epsilon archive made by the 42nd SC Epsilon house (3rd Epsilon house committee)
This repository serves as an archive containing past data, templates, project files to reference for future epsilon members.
Hopefully, you may find the resources avaliable here useful to your council term and learn from our mistakes or build onto our ideas.

It is optional (but highly recommended) to contribute to this archive for future council batches to refer to.

May your council be competent enough to not need to copy paste past year projects

Good luck

Ryan
